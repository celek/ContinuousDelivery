# Evidence
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence}

Collecting evidence is one of the essential aspects of the DevSecOps reference architecture. Compliance evidence creates the audit trail that auditors look for during a compliance audit. One of the goals of DevSecOps is automated evidence generation and storage in auditable evidence lockers.
{:shortdesc}

## Evidence format
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-format}

The `Evidence` type represents the schema of the evidence. Although the schema uses typescript syntax, you can convert it to use JSON schema.


```
interface Evidence {
  evidence_type_id: string;      // name of the evidence
  evidence_type_version: string; // version of the evidence schema
  date: string;                  // ISO-8601, UTC
  toolchain_crn: string;
  pipeline_id: string;
  pipeline_run_id: string;
  result: 'success' | 'failure';
  issues: string[];              // list of issues that were opened to track 'failed' state
  log: Artifact;                 // logs related to the evidence
  subject: string                // the repo url or artifact url
  artifacts: Artifact[];         // additional artifacts related to the evidence

  [origin]: {
    url: string; // origin of the evidence, e.g. path github where the task resides;
    version: string; // version of the task, e.g. git commit representing the code level used for that task
  }

  [key: string]: any;            // additional fields, described by `evidence_type_id` and `evidence_type_version`
}

interface Artifact {
  url: string;
  hash: string;
}
 ```

Some of the fields in the schema are specific to toolchains and Tekton pipelines:

```
toolchain_crn: string;
  pipeline_id: string;
  pipeline_run_id: string;
 ```
 
These fields identify the specific continuous integration or continuous delivery job that produced the evidence. They can also contain information from any continuous integration or continuous delivery job if they serve the same purpose. These fields identify scope size from the widest to the narrowest in the following order: `toolchain_crn` -> `pipeline_id` -> `pipeline_run_id`.

This schema is saved to the evidence locker by using JSON format. The evidence format that is collected in different pipeline stages does not differ. Currently, their saved path indicates the pipeline stage, such as continuous integration or continuous delivery.

### Example

    }
  ],
  "subject": "<evidence_collection_subject>‚Äù
}
```

Where *evidence_collection_subject* is the `repository_url` for a repo scan and the `artifactory_url` for an image scan.

## Evidence summary
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-summary}

The DevSecOps pipeline creates an evidence summary document. This document is based on evidence that is created during each of the continuous integration builds that deploy an image, and the evidence that is created during the deployment itself. The summary is created for the Change Request that is required to deploy any stage; it is also used by the Security and Compliance Center integration. 

The format and fields of the evidence summary document are specified by using the typescript syntax:

```
interface Summary {
  version: '1.0';                // schema version
  date: string;                  // ISO-8601, UTC, ie. YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
  toolchain_crn: string;         // CRN of the toolchain that generated the summary
  pipeline_id: string;           // ID of the pipeline that generated the summary
  pipeline_run_id: string;       // ID of the pipeline run that generated the summary
  evidences: Evidence[];
}
```

## Evidence creation
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-creation}

Evidence differs from artifacts that are created by pipeline stage steps, such as unit test results, or XML or JSON files. Each task must report to several tools that handle Evidence such as creating, formatting, and storing evidence.

Any generic test, check, or scan can produce evidence within a pipeline stage by using the steps within DevSecOps tools or pipelines that are shown in the following image. The DevSecOps tools must be able to receive the result of the task, to create the evidence, and then store it in the evidence locker.

 ![Evidence creation](images/evidence-creation.png)
 
The evidence format contains the result of the task (passing or failing), links to the created artifacts, and links to any incident issue that is created based on the Task result.

These tools focus only on evidence collection and do not change the behavior of your build process. The DevSecOps reference pipeline does not break due to failed Task results. An image can be built and deployed with failing tests and vulnerabilities if evidence of the checks and failures exists, the team is notified, a change request that is created during the deployment shows evidence of these issues, and the change request is manually approved.

## Evidence collection
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-collection}

According to the [DevOps lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide#toc-how-devops-u5vApdai){: external}, the continuous integration and continuous delivery flows can be divided into three stages: code, build, and deploy.

The DevOps architecture divides these flows into four stages by distinguishing between pre-production and production deployment. The DevSecOps reference architecture currently includes the pre-production and production deployment within the same stage.
{:tip: .tip}

Evidence is collected from the steps in each stage by using the same process that is used to [create evidence](#cd-devsecops-evidence-creation). The following image shows the current steps in the reference pipelines that produce evidence.

 ![Evidence collection](images/CI-CD-evidence.png)

### Code stage
{: #cd-devsecops-collection-code}

In the Code stage, evidence is collected for the following steps:

* Detect secrets
* Unit test results
* Code Vulnerability scan, CIS check, and Bill of Material check by way of Code Risk Analyzer

### Build stage
{: #cd-devsecops-collection-build}

In the Build stage, evidence is collected for the following steps:

* Vulnerability Advisor scan
* Image signing

### Deploy stage
{: #cd-devsecops-collection-deploy}

In the Deploy stage, evidence is collected for the following steps:

* Create change request
* Approval of change request
* Service specific tests
* Acceptance tests
* Closing the change request

## Evidence lockers
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-lockers}

Evidence and related artifacts, such as logs and test results are stored in evidence lockers. Because pipeline runs can easily be deleted, pipelines are considered non-durable. To create a retention policy and audit log, evidence data that is related to compliance is stored in lockers.

### Git Repos and Issue Tracking
{: #cd-devsecops-lockers-git}

Although it does not contain the data retention capabilities of Cloud Object Storage, Git is a simple implementation for an evidence locker.

The folder and file structure of the Git evidence locker is similar to the Cloud Object Storage implementation:

 ![Git evidence locker structure](images/git-structure.png)

### {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
{: #cd-devsecops-lockers-cos}

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} buckets, see [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets as evidence locker](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-devsecops-cos-bucket-evidence).

## Evidence flow
{: #cd-devsecops-evidence-flow}

The following diagram shows how the evidence is handled and flows through the stages of continuous integration and continuous delivery.

 ![Evidence flow](images/evidence-flow.png)
 
 Each piece of evidence that is collected in the various stages of the DevOps Architecture is stored in auditable evidence lockers. During deployment, this evidence is collected to create an evidence summary that is saved to the evidence locker at the end of the deployment run.

The evidence summary is attached to the change request, which is posted to the Change Request store. During a manual change request approval, the approver is aware of any issues that are found during the build. Additionally, the summary is submitted to the Security and Compliance Center.
