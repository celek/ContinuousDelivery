# Toolchain availability, templates, and tutorials  
{: #cd_about}
{: support}

Toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public. You can use a template as a starting point to create a toolchain.
{: shortdesc}

Although toolchains are not currently available in all regions, you can configure your toolchain to deploy your apps across all regions. To learn more, try the [Deploy a secure web application across multiple regions tutorial](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-multi-region-webapp).
{: tip}

## Toolchain templates
{: #templates}

You can use a template as a starting point to [create a toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create){: external}. Toolchain templates include specific sets of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

Some toolchain templates include tool integrations that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your resource group, when you click **Create** to create the toolchain, the service is automatically added with the selected free Lite plan. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/){: external}.

The "Develop and test microservices on Cloud Foundry" toolchain deploys an app with catalog and orders APIs that are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying the app, a no-cost Cloudant service instance is created. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/){: external}.

The predefined DevOps toolchain templates are recommended examples that solve real world scenarios and each contains a sample app. You can use your own app by specifying your Git repo when you create the toolchain from the template.
