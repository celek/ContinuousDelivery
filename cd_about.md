# Toolchain availability, templates, and tutorials  
{: #cd_about}
{: support}

Toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public and Dedicated. You can use a template as a starting point to create a toolchain.
{: shortdesc}

## Toolchain availability on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public compared to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated
{: #public_and_dedicated}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public is an open-standards, cloud-based platform where you can build, run, and manage applications that are accessed by [http://cloud.ibm.com](http://cloud.ibm.com){: external}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated provides the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in a dedicated infrastructure environment that is securely connected to both the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public environment and your network. Your company's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same tool integrations as the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public site.

For source-code management and issue tracking, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public generally uses {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} (hosted by IBM and built on [GitLab Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/){: external}) or GitHub (github.com). {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated can also use github.com.

{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} is available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public in selected regions, and on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated. Toolchains differ depending on whether you use {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated.

Although toolchains are not currently available in all regions, you can configure your toolchain to deploy your apps across all regions. To learn more, try the [Deploy a secure web application across multiple regions tutorial](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-multi-region-webapp).

## Toolchain templates
{: #templates}

You can use a template as a starting point to [create a toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create){: external}. Toolchain templates include specific sets of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

Your company's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same toolchain templates as the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public site. Toolchain templates that are available on both {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated might contain a different set of tool integrations on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dedicated.
{: note}

Some toolchain templates include tool integrations that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your resource group or organization, when you click **Create** to create the toolchain, the service is automatically added with the selected free Lite plan. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/){: external}.

The "Develop and test microservices on Cloud Foundry" toolchain deploys an app with catalog and orders APIs that are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying the app, a no-cost Cloudant service instance is created. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/){: external}.

The predefined DevOps toolchain templates are recommended examples that solve real world scenarios and each contains a sample app. You can use your own app by specifying your Git repo when you create the toolchain from the template.
