# Working with {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Workers
{: #private-workers}

The {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} uses public and private workers to run pipeline jobs. By default, pipeline jobs are run by using public workers on IBM-managed public shared infrastructure. 
{: shortdesc}

In certain scenarios, your {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} might require access to internal or on-premises resources. In these situations, you can connect to and integrate a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker to run on your own Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
{: #private_workers_prereqs}

Before you set up a private worker, make sure that you have the following resources in place:

* A Kubernetes cluster. You must have a cluster to install a private worker. You can provide your own cluster or you can [set up a cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external} from the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.

* Optional. A toolchain with a pipeline that contains at least one stage. You can create a toolchain by using the [{{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-private-workers#configure_private_worker_integration). You can also create a toolchain by using the **Develop a Kubernetes app** toolchain template:

  1. Log in to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](http://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.
  2. Go to [https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create){: external} and select the **Develop a Kubernetes app** toolchain template.
  3. Complete the fields for the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}.
  4. Click **Create** to create your Kubernetes app toolchain.

## Setting up a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker
{: #set_up_private_worker}

Toolchains provide an integrated set of tools to build, deploy, and manage your apps. Tool integrations are the building blocks of a toolchain. A pipeline that is contained within a toolchain that has one or more private worker integrations has extra options available on the **Workers** tab of the Stage Configuration page.

Complete the following steps to set up a private worker:

1. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration for your toolchain.
2. Configure your Kubernetes cluster with a private worker.
3. Use the private worker in your pipeline.

### Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration
{: #configure_private_worker_integration}

Complete the following steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration for your toolchain:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on your app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**. Then, click **Overview**.

 a. Click **Add tool**.

 b. In the Tool Integrations section, click **{{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker**.

1. Type a name for the tool integration. This name identifies a pool of private workers in the **Workers** tab of the pipeline stage.
1. Type your service ID API key to authenticate access to the work queue where one or more private workers can look for work. If you don't have a service ID API key, click **Create** to generate one for this private worker.
1. Click **Create Integration**.
1. From your toolchain, click **{{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker** to view a list of all of the workers that are registered by using an API key that is associated with this service ID.

The list of workers is empty until you use {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} private workers for the first time. 
{: tip}

For more information about the **{{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker** tool integration, see [Configuring {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-privateworker).

 {: tip}
 
1. Click **Save**.
1. You can manually run your stage or wait for a trigger to run the jobs on the stage by using the specified private worker on the associated Kubernetes cluster. You can view the log file output for the jobs to determine which worker was used.  

### Verifying the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker output
{: #pw_verify_output}

If you are assigned the Toolchain Editor role, you can view the pipeline execution logs in the Stage History page of the pipeline.

If you are assigned the Toolchain Administrator role, you can also verify the Kubernetes resources in the installation, by way of the kubectl CLI. 

|Action |Command	|
|:----------|:------------------------------|
| View the list of namespaces in the cluster		|`$ kubectl get ns` (while the pipeline is running). At least one namespace, prefixed with `pw-` is returned during the pipeline job execution. For example, `pw-f0fb3cdb-5173-4785-ae92-bb05268e041e`. 		|
|View the pod that is running the pipeline job		|`$ kubectl get pods -n pw-f0fb3cdb-5173-4785-ae92-bb05268e041e`   |
|Start a bash session within a pod that is named `pw-f0fb3cdb-5173-4785-ae92-bb05268e041e`		|`kubectl -n pw-f0fb3cdb-5173-4785-ae92-bb05268e041e exec -it job-pod-e56e78 bash`		|

## Modifying the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration credentials
{: #modify_private_worker}

After you set up your private worker, you can update the credentials that are used for the tool integration. You might want to change these credentials if they are deleted, expired, or compromised. You can update the credentials by creating a new service ID or by updating the API key.

### Creating a service ID
{: #create_service_id}

A service ID identifies a service or an application in the same way that a user ID identifies a user. You can use a service ID to enable an application outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} to access your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service. For more information about service IDs, see [Creating and working with service IDs](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids).

Complete the following steps to create a service ID:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on your app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**.
1. On the card for the private workers tool integration that you want to modify, click the menu, and then click **Configure** to access the configuration options.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Enter a name and description for the service ID.
1. Click **Save Integration**.
1. On the DevOps dashboard, on the **Toolchains** page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**.
1. Click the card for the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration that you want to specify new user credentials for.
1. Click **Getting Started**, and complete steps 2 and 3 to register and verify the private worker on your cluster.

### Updating the API key
{: #update_api_key}

An API key is a unique code that is passed to an API to identify the application or user that is calling it. To prevent malicious use of an API, you can use API keys to track and control how that API is used. For more information about API keys, see [Understanding API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey).

Complete the following steps to update the API key for use with the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on your app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**.
1. On the card for the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration that you want to modify, click the menu, and then click **Configure** to access the configuration options.
1. Specify your new API key. 
1. Click **Save Integration**.

You can revoke access to a private worker by deleting the corresponding API key. Due to caching policies and invalidation, it might take up to 60 minutes for a deleted API key to prevent jobs from running. For more information about deleting an API key, see [Deleting an API key for a service ID](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys#delete_service_key).
{: tip}

## Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker
{: #delete_private_worker}

Complete the following steps to delete a private worker:

1. Delete the private worker from the pool of workers.
1. Delete the private worker from your Kubernetes cluster.

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker from the pool of workers

Complete the following steps to delete the private worker from the pool of workers:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on your app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**.
1. Click the card for the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration that you want to configure.
1. Click **Overview**.
1. Click the menu for the private worker that you want to delete to access the configuration options.
1. Click **Remove** and then click **Confirm**.  

If you delete all of the private workers from a pool of workers, subsequent stage runs fail and the `No workers currently registered` message is displayed in the Stage History. 
{: important}

Although deleting a private worker tool integration from a toolchain prevents that toolchain from using the pool of workers, other toolchains might still use the worker pool. You can delete a pool of workers from all toolchains by deleting the service ID that is associated with the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration.
{: tip}

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker from your Kubernetes cluster

If you delete the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration from a toolchain and the private worker is configured for a pipeline stage, it is still listed in the **Workers** tab of the Stage Configuration page. However, the private worker is disabled and labeled REMOVED. You must select a different private worker (if one exists) or use a public worker instead.
{: tip}


## Updating a {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker
{: #update_private_workers}
 
Private workers can have one of the following statuses:
 
 * **active**: The private worker is operating normally.
 * **inactive**: The private worker is offline. Check your cluster. You might need to register the private worker again.
 * **outdated**: The private worker is not the latest version. Although the private worker continues to operate normally, it is recommended that you update to the latest version.
 * **unsupported**: The private worker version in use is no longer supported. The private worker cannot run and you need to update to the latest version.

Complete the following steps to update a private worker to use the latest version:
 
1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on your app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View toolchain**.
1. Click the card for the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} Private Worker tool integration that you want to update.
1. Click **Getting Started** and use the commands that are listed to complete the following actions:
