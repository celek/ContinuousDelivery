# Observe trends over time
{: #observe-trends}

The Quality Trends page shows the number of test cases that are passed or failed for a particular build. You can view trends for quality data sets such as unit tests, functional verification tests, code coverages, SonarQube scans, and security scans for builds.

For more information about data sets, see [Managing data sets](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-adding-data-sets).

The following figure shows unit test trends for builds from the master branch, and the number of passed and failed test cases for the build.

The quality trends graph correlates with the quality dashboard, and it is a good reference for noticing patterns in your builds. You can view trends for all test data. To view your quality trends dashboard, from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. Select your toolchain. Click the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tile, and then click **Quality Trends**. 

Click the dots within the graph to find out why there are dips in quality.
