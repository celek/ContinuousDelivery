# Image signing: generating a GPG key
{: #cd-devsecops-image-signing}

Images that are built by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DevSecOps continuous integration toolchain and recorded in the inventory must be signed before they are deployed to production. The continuous integration pipeline uses [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo){: external} as the default tool to provide image signing capability.
{: shortdesc}

Complete these steps to create and store a GPG key that is used by the DevSecOps continuous integration pipeline.

## Download and install GPG command-line tools
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-download}

Download and install the [GPG command-line tools](https://www.gnupg.org/download/){: external} for your operating system. Go to the `GnuPG binary releases` section to download the required tools for your operating system.

### OS X
 * Download and install [Mac GPG](https://gpgtools.org/){: external}
 * Verify the version of the installed GPG. From the Terminal command prompt, run the following command:

  ```
  $ gpg --version
  gpg (GnuPG) 2.3.1
  libgcrypt 1.9.3
  Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  ```
  * For versions of gpg lower than 2.3.1, it may not be possible to use the `--passphrase=''` option. In this case, the  password can be omitted in the following dialog by hitting enter when prompted.

### Windows  
 * Download and install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/){: external} (required for `base64` encoding)
 * Verify the version of the installed GPG. From the Git bash command prompt, run the following command:

  ```
  $ gpg --version
  gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.27
  libgcrypt 1.8.7
  Copyright (C) 2021 g10 Code GmbH
  ```

## Generate a GPG key
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-generate}

Leave the passphrase and repeat field empty if the generate-key commands open a dialog asking for a passphrase. This is a limitation with the [(skopeo)](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/issues/1261){: external} utility of the image signing where the pipeline cannot accept a private key that is protected with a passphrase. If you provide the passphrase during creation, then your pipeline will fail to decode the certificate, and your pipeline will fail at the image signing step.
{: important}

### OS X and Linux
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-linux}

From your shell prompt, run:
  ```
  gpg --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase='' --generate-key
  ```

 * Enter `Real name`
 * Enter `Email address`
 * Enter `O` to initiate key creation
 * Once key is generated, select Option `O`

### Windows
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-windows}

#### GPG Version > 1.4
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-version}

From the Git bash command prompt, run:
  ```
  gpg --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase='' --generate-key
  ```

 * Enter `Real name`: your name
 * Enter `Email address`: you email address
 * Enter `O` to initiate key creation
 * Once key is generated, select Option `O`

#### GPG Version < 1.4 (or any failure with above command)
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-version2}

From the Git bash command prompt, run:
  ```
  gpg --gen-key
  ```

 * `kind of key`: select Default option `(1) RSA and RSA (default)`
 * `keysize`: keep default (2048)
 * `key validity`: keep default (0 = key does not expire)
 * confirm your choice: enter `y`
 * Enter `Real name`: your name
 * Enter `Email address`: you email address
 * Enter `comment`: any comment of your choice
 * Enter `O` to initiate key creation

## Verify the key creation
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-verify}

Verify that the gpg key was created. From the command prompt, run:
  ```
  gpg --list-keys
  ```

Ensure that your key is listed. Example output on Windows:
  ```
  $ gpg --list-keys
  /c/Users/FredSmith/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
  -------------------------------------
  pub   2048R/1BB354B5 2021-06-08
  uid   Fred Smith <fred@company.com>
  sub   2048R/F91C39A6 2021-06-08
  ```
  {: screen}

## Export the key
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-export}

This step is optional. Run this command to ensure that the gpg key can be exported. 
  ```
  gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address>
  ```

The raw key exported here must not be copied directly. It is strongly recommended to securely store the key generated in this step in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance or {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. See the next sections for more details.
{: important}

## Store the key
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-store}

The GPG key must be provided to the CI pipeline in one of the following ways:
 * Stored in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}}
 * Stored in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full}}
 * Stored directly in the CI toolchain

Make sure that the key is copied in the correct format to prevent a CI pipeline signing error due to import failure. Use `pbcopy` (OS X) or `clip` (Windows / Git bash) in the following command to copy the key content to the clipboard.
{: note}

### Store the key in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-store-keyprotect}

Double `base64` encoding of the GPG key is required before storing it in your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance.
{: note}

Export and copy the GPG key to the clipboard.

#### OS X 
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-copy-osx}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 | base64 | pbcopy
```

#### Windows
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-copy-windows}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 -w0 | base64 -w0 | clip
```

#### Linux
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-copy-linux}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 | base64
```

1. In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, select the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance where you want to store the GPG key generated from the previous steps.
2. Click on the `Add +` icon on the top right to add new key to the instance.
3. Select `Import your own key` option
4. Select `Select a key type` as **Standard Key**
5. Give appropriate name in the `Key name` field. The stored GPG key can be retrieved later by this name.
6. Copy the key as exported earlier in the `Key material` field.
    Ensure that while copying the key and pasting it in `Key material` field, there is no extra line at the end of the key.
    {: note}
7. Select the `Choose a key ring` option as default. 
8. Add the key to your key protect by clicking `Add key` icon at the bottom.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, see [the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} docs](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about).

### Store the key in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-store-secretsmgr}

Single `base64` encoding of the GPG key is required before storing it in your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance.
{: note}

Export and copy the GPG key to the clipboard.

#### OS X
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-export-osx}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 | pbcopy
```

#### Windows
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-export-windows}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 -w0 | clip
```

#### Linux
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-export-linux}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64
```

1. In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, select the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance where you want to store GPG Key generated from the previous steps.
2. Click on the `Add +` icon on the top right to add new key to the instance.
3. Select `Other secret type` option

| ![Save key to {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} - Step 1](/images/devsecops_set-up_store_secret_manager_1.png) |
| :--: |

4. Select `Select a key type` as **Standard Key**
5. Give appropriate name in the `Name` field. The stored GPG key can be retreived later by this name.
6. Choose the option as `Secret value` and paste the key as exported earlier in the `Secret Value` field.
    Ensure that while copying the key and pasting it in `Secret value` field, there is no extra line at the end of the key.
    {: note}
7. Add the key to your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance by clicking `Add` icon at the bottom.

### Export the private key and store it directly in the CI pipeline
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-private-key}
This approach is not recommended and should be used only for experimentation purpose. Use `keyprotect` or `secrets manager` for storing the keys.

Single `base64` encoding of the GPG key is required before storing it as a secured pipeline property. 
{: note}

Securely store the GPG key in a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance.
{: important}

#### OS X / Linux
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-store-osx}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64
```

#### Windows
{: #cd-devsecops-gpg-store-windows}

```
gpg --export-secret-key <Email Address> | base64 -w0
```
