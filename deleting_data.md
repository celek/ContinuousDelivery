# Deleting your {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data
{: #deleting_data}

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} hosts your data in a highly available and secure environment. Client and system credentials are stored on encrypted disks. Access to data is limited to only those users that require the data to support and maintain {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. Data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} is indexed by a toolchain ID. When you delete a toolchain, all of the data that is related to repos that was collected as part of the toolchain is deleted.
{: shortdesc}

You can delete data in following ways:

- Delete build, test, and deploy records
- Delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data for a repo by disabling
- Delete integration between Toolchain and {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}
- Delete a repo from your toolchain

For more information about toolchains, see [Creating a toolchain from an app](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started#creating_a_toolchain_from_an_app).

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} doesn't manage data in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. If you stop using {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}, you must delete your own data. To delete your data, delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration from your toolchain. If the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration is not added again to the toolchain within seven days, the data is deleted.
