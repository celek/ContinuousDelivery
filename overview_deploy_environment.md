Risk analysis is useful for customers that deploy to several environments. You can view all of your apps deployments and deployment environments. With risk analysis, you get an overview of the risks that are associated with your applications from all of your environments. The Risk Analysis page is automatically populated with the most recent information that is sent from your continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools.

Within the risk analysis dashboard you can select from two tabs: **Application** and **Environment**. Within the **Application** tab, you can see the number of active builds and risk evaluations for each of your apps. In the **Environment** tab, you can view the location of the app, the number of deployed applications, and the risk evaluations associated with the environment.
