# Bringing your own app to DevSecOps
{: #cd-devsecops-apps-byoa}

You can bring your own application (app) to a DevSecOps toolchain for continuous integration and continuous delivery. 
{: shortdesc}

Create your DevSecOps toolchain by using the default sample app that is provided. This sample app hosts a nodeJs server that provides a static web page. The source code  of the sample app contains a `.pipeline-config.yaml` file. The `.pipeline-config.yaml` file is the core configuration file that is used by continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchains for all of the stages in the pipeline run process.

1. Add a `.pipeline-config.yaml` configuration file that contains the following properties that are required by each stage: 

 * **image**: The Docker image name that is used to run the stage. For example, use the following code to sign your images:

   ```
    image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/image-signing:1.0.0@sha256:e9d8e354668ba3d40be2aaee08298d2aa7f0e1c8a1829cca4094ec93830e3e6a
    ```

 * **abort_on_failure**: Set this property to `true` to stop the pipeline run if the stage fails.
 * **script**: The script that performs the actions that are required in the stage. Create the scripts in the script directory within the app repository (repo), and call the scripts from this location. For example, the following code snippet shows the content of the `script` section when you want to sign the images:

   ```
   script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      STAGE_DIND="true"
      STAGE_ABORT_ON_FAILURE="false"
      STAGE_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY="IfNotPresent"
      source scripts/sign_image.sh
   ```
 * **dind**: Set this property to `true` if you want to enable `docker` functionality in the running pipeline. After you determine which parameters are required in the step, you can define various steps in the pipeline.

 * **setup**: Define this stage to run the pre-setup scripts.

  ```
 setup:
   image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/pipeline-base-image:2.12@sha256:ff4053b0bca784d6d105fee1d008cfb20db206011453071e86b69ca3fde706a4
   script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    echo "Please insert any required pre-build tasks in this stage."
 ```
   
 * **test**: Define this stage to run the test cases of the app.

 ```
test:
  abort_on_failure: false
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/pipeline-base-image:2.12@sha256:ff4053b0bca784d6d105fee1d008cfb20db206011453071e86b69ca3fde706a4
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    cd ../"$(load_repo app-repo path)"
    #npm ci
    #npm test
    source test/test.sh
```
 * **containerize**: Define this stage to build and containerize your app.

 ```
containerize:
  dind: true
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/pipeline-base-image:2.12@sha256:ff4053b0bca784d6d105fee1d008cfb20db206011453071e86b69ca3fde706a4
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    if [[ "$PIPELINE_DEBUG" == 1 ]]; then
      trap env EXIT
      env
      set -x
    fi
    source scripts/build_setup.sh
    source scripts/build.sh
```
 * **deploy**: Define this stage to deploy your app on the target environment.

 ```
deploy:
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/pipeline-base-image:2.12@sha256:ff4053b0bca784d6d105fee1d008cfb20db206011453071e86b69ca3fde706a4
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    if [[ "$PIPELINE_DEBUG" == 1 ]]; then
      trap env EXIT
      env
      set -x
    fi
    source scripts/deploy_setup.sh
    source scripts/deploy.sh
```
 * **sign-artifact**: Define this stage to sign your built images.

 ```
sign-artifact:
  abort_on_failure: false
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/image-signing:1.0.0@sha256:e9d8e354668ba3d40be2aaee08298d2aa7f0e1c8a1829cca4094ec93830e3e6a
  script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      STAGE_DIND="true"
      STAGE_ABORT_ON_FAILURE="false"
      STAGE_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY="IfNotPresent"
      source scripts/sign_image.sh
```
 * **acceptance-test**: Define this stage run your acceptance test after deployment.

  ```
acceptance-test:
  abort_on_failure: false
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/pipeline/pipeline-base-image:2.12@sha256:ff4053b0bca784d6d105fee1d008cfb20db206011453071e86b69ca3fde706a4
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    export APP_URL=$(cat ../app-url)
    source scripts/setup_go.sh
    echo "APP_URL :- ${APP_URL}"
    go run acceptance-test/acceptance-test.test.go
```
 * **release**: Define this stage to upload evidence and artifacts that are generated from the previous stages.

 ```
release:
  abort_on_failure: false
  image: icr.io/continuous-delivery/toolchains/devsecops/compliance-baseimage:2.26.1@sha256:a780174a64474187b01b5e40a1721d8307f02897ac6f3eba2d482d4f4926edf1
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    source scripts/release.sh
```
